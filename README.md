## Things that are currently broken, and require some attention
- Converting coordinates to worldspace from screen space
- Perspective isn't working as intended, objects don't become smaller as they go "into" the z axis
- ...

## To be done
- Cube sampler
- Optimizations
- Debug output, and fancy visualizations
